# TrapGen 🎛️🎶 
**AI-Powered Trap Beat Generator**

TrapGen is a neural beat generation system designed to produce trap-style drum and melody sequences using PyTorch RNNs, audio synthesis, and a dynamic GUI. Built for producers, researchers, and creative technologists, this tool combines rhythmic neural modeling with real-time audio layering to output unique, high-quality beats from curated samples.

## 🔥 Sample Outputs

This repository includes **three sample `.mp3` files** generated by TrapGen using different configuration profiles:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `sample1.mp3` | 70 BPM, default melody speed, all instruments enabled, flat EQ |
| `sample2.mp3` | 85 BPM, slowed melody (0.6x), no claps or snares, boosted low EQ |
| `sample3.mp3` | 130 BPM, fast melody (1.5x), no 808s, boosted high EQ |

These demonstrate the variety of outputs achievable with the TrapGen engine by tuning different parameters: BPM, melody speed, instrument layers, and EQ shaping.

## 🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/TrapGen.git](https://github.com/yourusername/TrapGen.git)
cd TrapGen
Prepare your environment:
Ensure you have ffmpeg installed and samples placed in the samples/ folder.

Run the app:

Bash
python trap_gui.py

---

## Use the GUI:

Adjust BPM with the slider (20–200 BPM).

Tune melody speed (0.2x to 2.0x) for double time or slowed vibes.

Select which instruments to include (KICK, SNARE, CLAP, HAT, 808).

Adjust EQ bands (Low, Mid, High) to sculpt your mix.

Click Generate to build a beat.

Click Export to save as .wav or .mp3.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Neural Pattern Generation**: PyTorch RNNs generate per-instrument rhythms from seed sequences
- ✅ **Tkinter GUI**: Interactive desktop interface with BPM, instrument toggles, EQ, and melody speed control
- ✅ **Sample Layering Engine**: Combines kick, snare, clap, hi-hat, 808, and melodic loops into synchronized master tracks
- ✅ **Humanization & Swing**: Random off-beat swing for more natural rhythm feel
- ✅ **Export to WAV/MP3**: Save beats with built-in post-processing (compression, fade, EQ)
